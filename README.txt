# general descriptionSimulation, analysis and plotting codes for:[1] Sadeh and Rotter. Orientation selectivity in inhibition-dominatednetworks of spiking neurons: effect of single neuron properties andnetwork dynamics. PLOS Computational Biology 2015.This code was contributed by Sadra Sadeh.Needs: NEST, Python[The current codes are written compatible with NEST 2.6.0 andPython 3; efforts have been made, however, to be backward compatible]# list of files(1) OS_source.pySource file comprising the main Class for NEST simulations(2) OS_params.pyDefault parameters of simulations in [1](3) OS_run.pyUses OS_source to run network simulations with parameters read from OS_params(4) OS_functions.pyFunctions needed for analysis of the results(5) OS_results.pyPre-processing and analysis of the results [Note: OS_results only works if no file called "results" exists in thesimulation folder, so by default the results is not overwritten toavoid analysing an already processed data. Delete "results" from thefolder if you want to re-analyse the data.](6) OS_Figure1.pyAnalysis and plotting of the simulations in Figure 1 of [1]# to run the simulation and plot the figure, follow these steps:(i) run (3): it saves spike trains and membrane potential out ofsimulations(ii) run (5): it pre-processes results of (3) and generates tuningcurves, etc(iii) run (6): it analyses the results of (5) and plots Figure 1
